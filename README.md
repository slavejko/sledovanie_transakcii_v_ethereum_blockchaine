## Repository navigation

The project is divided into branches. Each branch is its own separate part of the application. 
The installation process for each branch is described in that branch's readme file.

- Branch [server](https://github.com/slavejko/sledovanie_transakcii_v_ethereum_blockchaine/tree/server) is used to run the application. For this to run successfully, data will need to be provided.

- Branch [data](https://github.com/slavejko/sledovanie_transakcii_v_ethereum_blockchaine/tree/data) contains data files for one day,
-  specifically for 19th of March, 2022. This dataset was made using python script from branch 
-  [data_import_python](https://github.com/slavejko/sledovanie_transakcii_v_ethereum_blockchaine/tree/data_import_python), 
-  so if there is desire for more data, that can be done following instructions from that branch.

- Branch [data_import_python](https://github.com/slavejko/sledovanie_transakcii_v_ethereum_blockchaine/tree/data_import_python) hosts python script and manual on how to import and process data from blockchain into the database.
